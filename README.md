# Smart-Mining-Helmet
This hemlet is a IoT device which allows us to monitor the mine conditions with the help of diffrent sensors placed on a miners helmet.
This project utilises ThingSpeak IoT analytics for monitoring the data over cloud. Data from the sensors gets pushed to the cloud every 15 seconds.
